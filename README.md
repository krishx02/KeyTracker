# KeyTracker

This is a new project that I am going to work on during the Winter Break. I am going to be using Java and hopefully I can implement some of the data structures that I learned in CS112 at Rutgers University - New Brunswick.

Main Ideas Behind The Project:
I am going to make a program that can track keys that someone types on their keyboard. Since I play games, sometimes its cool to find out exactly how much you press an individual key and I want to develop a program that accomplishes this. 

Rhythm Games
I play a game called osu, and I found a program that does exactly what I want my program to do, but some of the features aren't exactly how I would like. I am using this program as inspiration. The main thing that I want to focus on is the AVG section and the MAX section that perhaps I could improve upon. Here is the link to the inspiration for this project.

Steps I am taking to accomplish this project:
I will most likely use a lot of online resources as there is a lot of things I am going to experiment with.
First I am going to try and develop the program within VSCode t
Ten develop a working UI, as I think that might be the most difficult part for me to accomplish

As of 12/22/2020 (I know its been a day) I am putting this project on hold. I looked into Roan's KPS software and honestly the things that he is doing is too complex for me to understand at the moment, but I will definitely work on this project sometime in the future.
